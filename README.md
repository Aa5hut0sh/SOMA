# 🌕 SOMA - Surface Observation and Mapping Algorithm

**Novel method for detecting landslides and boulders on the Moon using Chandrayaan-1/2 imagery**

---

## 🚀 Overview

SOMA is a modular, open-source Python pipeline designed to detect **lunar landslides** and **boulders** using satellite imagery and terrain datasets from **Chandrayaan-1 and 2 missions**. It uses terrain modeling, image processing, and statistical feature extraction to highlight geological activities such as mass movements and boulder falls on the Moon.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Landslides and boulder falls on the Moon are critical indicators of recent geological activities. Due to steep slopes and unique surface conditions, conventional Earth-based methods fall short in lunar scenarios.

This project addresses the challenge by proposing a **novel algorithm** capable of:
- Detecting landslides from DTM, OHRC, and TMC images.
- Detecting and measuring individual boulders.
- Highlighting active zones using terrain slope and imagery cues.
- Working across all lunar regions.

## 📸 Key Features

- ✅ **Automated Landslide Detection** using elevation slope and gradient analysis
- 🪨 **Boulder Detection & Measurement** using contour segmentation
- 📏 **Dimension Estimation** (diameter, bounding box, area)
- 🌋 **Mass Movement Source Decoding**
- 🔥 **Risk Heatmap Generation**
- 🌐 **Region-Agnostic (any part of the Moon)**
- 📊 **Detailed Metadata Output** (.csv/.json)
- 🖥️ **Modern UI** for visualization and image upload

## 📈 Outputs

- `boulders.png`: Detected boulders with dimension annotations
- `landslides.png`: Highlighted regions of potential mass movement
- `heatmap.png`: Risk map showing active zones
- `boulder_stats.csv`: Diameter, area, position data for each boulder
- `report.pdf`: Pdf file containing all stats and generated images

## 💡 Novel Contributions

SOMA is distinct because:

- It integrates **terrain slope + elevation + image morphology**
- It uses **object-based segmentation + pixel geometry** for boulder size estimation
- It includes a **source decoding module** to trace landslide origins
- It is **data-agnostic**: applicable to any Moon region with suitable imagery
